                    I found this toy in a second hand shop. 
                    It has a clear plastic shell with small tiles numbered 1-50 on the inside. 
                    There is a small "selector column" on the left which
                    can be used to separate a few of the tiles from the rest. 
                    Who knows its original purpose, but to me it seems a sort of lottery number picker.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I was curious, how random are these numbers really? 
                    I built a small testing rig, a DC motor with a hall sensor attached to detect each full rotation. 
                    On each spin, a photograph was taken. Using computer vision techniques, the tiles were individually 
                    extracted from the selector column of each image. They were then identified 
                    using a neural network. In total, 42 kilobits of data was collected.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The bitstream was run through the NIST's Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators. 
                    In the end, it was found to be random in 7 of the tests and non-random in 9.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    What a shame. I really wanted it to be more random.
