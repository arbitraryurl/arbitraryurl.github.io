            <i>43% Random</i><br>

I found this toy in a second hand shop. It has a clear plastic shell with small tiles numbered 1-50 on the inside. There is a small "selector column" on the left which can be used to separate a few of the tiles from the rest. Who knows its original purpose, but to me it seems a sort of lottery number picker.<br><br>

I was curious, how random are these numbers really? I built a small testing rig, a DC motor with a hall sensor attached to detect each full rotation. On each spin, a photograph was taken. Using computer vision techniques, the tiles were individually extracted from the selector column of each image. They were then identified using a neural network. In total, 42 kilobits of data was collected.<br><br>

The bitstream was run through the NIST's Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators. In the end, it was found to be random in 7 of the tests and non-random in 9.<br><br>

What a shame. I really wanted it to be more random.
